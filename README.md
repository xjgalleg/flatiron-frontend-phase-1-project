Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Builder
> Basic deck builder that includes all Yu-gi-oh trading cards.

This deck builder can help anyone build a deck from scratch.

## Installing / Getting started

clone repository, open index.html, start using search form to search up cards

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.
